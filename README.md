## 🎓 What I Learned

Building this project taught me:

- **MLOps Fundamentals**: Automated model retraining, deployment strategies, and model governance
- **CI/CD for ML**: How to build GitHub Actions workflows specifically for machine learning
- **API Design**: Creating production-ready REST APIs with FastAPI and Pydantic validation
- **Experiment Tracking**: Using MLflow for model versioning and metrics logging
- **Smart Deployment**: Implementing quality gates and automated decision logic
- **DevOps**: Containerization, cloud deployment, and infrastructure as code

### Key Takeaways

1. **Automation is King**: Manual model updates don't scale - automation is essential
2. **Quality Gates Matter**: Not every new model should be deployed automatically
3. **Version Everything**: Models, data, and code all need versioning
4. **Documentation is Crucial**: Good docs make projects accessible and impressive
5. **End-to-End Thinking**: ML projects need more than just model training
